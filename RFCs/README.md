## Publication Howto

RFCs are redacted using ietf markdown syntax which adds some custom extensions to
kramdown flavored markdown. RCFs in this folder uses non standard `.kmd` extension to
prevent github to try rendering them as markdown *(output is difficult to read due to
the ietf extensions...)*.

If you want to visualize a new version of a `.kmd` file in this folder, copy content of
the file to `draft.mkd` *(mind the different extension)* and provides this file to the
ietf [Author Tools][2]. You can then visualize the RFC as formatted html or text...

To emit a new version of an ongoing Internet Draft document, starts by editing the front
matter of the document adjusting fields:
* docname: by incrementing the revision number at the end of docname by 1
* date: by putting the date of the day.
Then copy this document to `${docname}.mkd` file 

Then login to ietf [Author Tools][2] site, and upload the `${docname}.mkd` file.
You can first visualize the uploaded file using the Text or HTML output generated by the
[Author Tools][2], then when ready uses `Diff with Latest` tool to make sure the changes
are the ones you intented and that the docname is correct. Finally convert the
`${docname}.mkd` file to xml using the `XML` tool, download the generated xml and
proceed to [Internet-Draft submission][3]...
