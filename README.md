# README

KerPass explores using **Ephemeral** Secrets *(aka time synchronous OTPs...)* generated
by the [EPHEMSEC][1] algorithm, with [PAKE][2], [Noise-PSK][3] &  [TLS-PSK][4] key
exchange methods to secure user facing applications.

## Project Goals
* Specify the [EPHEMSEC][1] OTP/OTK generation algorithm
* Delivers reference implementation of the cryptography required to support the project.
* Explore usability & integration issues generated by the usage of PAKE & PSKs with
  ephemeral credentials.

## Software development
* This repository holds reference implementation of project cryptography and protocols.
* A smartphone Authenticator app is under development and will be open sourced when
  mature
* Various server components are being developped that will be open sourced here.
